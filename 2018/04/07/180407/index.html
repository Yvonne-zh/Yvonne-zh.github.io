How to curb the killing</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE planet has rarely been so peaceful. Even with terrible fighting in such places as Congo, Syria and Yemen, wars between and within countries are becoming less common and less deadly. <strong><font color="red">But a dark menace looms.</font></strong> Some of the developing world’s cities <strong>threaten to be <font color="red">engulfed</font> by</strong> murder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Congo</strong>-刚果 <strong>Syria</strong>-叙利亚 <strong>Yemen</strong>-也门</p>
<p><strong>But a dark menace looms.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/menace" target="_blank" rel="external">menace</a>: If it’s threatening you or otherwise posing some sort of danger, then it’s a menace. Angry rabid dogs, smog clouds, and annoying little brothers are all probable menaces.<ul>
<li>Gen. H. R. McMaster, in his final speech as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, warned darkly about the growing Russian menace.</li>
<li>Here and elsewhere in France, Salafism is increasingly seen as the enemy, a menacing way-station to terrorism.</li>
<li>But Russians seem open to persuasion that they constitute a twin menace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/loom" target="_blank" rel="external">loom</a>: Loom has two distinct meanings. First, it’s a tool for weaving. Second, it means to appear or stand over someone in a threatening way. The future <em>loomed</em> grim. The shadow <em>loomed</em> above us.<ul>
<li>His characters’ irreverent crusading and euphoric protest, even as death looms, are a fitting tribute to such work.</li>
<li>The only thing that loomed, the only cloud that seemed likely to grow, was Rizzo’s contract situation.</li>
<li>There also is a looming shortfall of more than $120 billion in the Highway Trust Fund, a major source of road and transit spending, with no agreement on how it should be addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the developing world’s cities <strong>threaten to be engulfed by</strong> murder.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/engulf" target="_blank" rel="external">engulf</a>: Engulf is a verb that means being completely surrounded, soaked, or covered. Fire, snow, smoke, flood waters, or even violence are a few things that could engulf you.<ul>
<li>The loveliness of the images in these moments eases the trauma that threatens to engulf him and the movie.</li>
<li>Although Ms. Park is expected to appeal the verdict, the sentencing is likely to bring a sense of closure to the corruption scandal that engulfed her.</li>
<li>But with a new wave of scandals engulfing some of the nation’s corporate titans, it would behoove them to honestly assess the ultimate purpose of their charity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the 560,000 violent deaths around the world in 2016, 68% were murders; wars caused just 18%. Murder has been <strong>falling in</strong> rich countries (though London is suffering an outbreak—see article), but it has long <strong>plagued</strong> Latin America and is <strong>starting to</strong> climb in parts of southern Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The world often <strong><font color="red">goes to great lengths to stop wars</font></strong>. Just imagine if it put as much effort into stopping murders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/plague" target="_blank" rel="external">plague</a>: any large-scale calamity (especially when thought to be sent by God); any epidemic disease with a high death rate; an annoyance</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a gruesome crime that pained many in the city, and focused public attention, however briefly, on the security problems that plague many of the developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority.</li>
<li>And corruption of various sorts still plagues airlines across the world.</li>
<li>In spite of this, I’m plagued by a bizarre, irrational and retroactive jealousy of her past relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/startle" target="_blank" rel="external">startle</a>: To startle is to jump, like when you’re surprised. If you’re sneaking through a dark room and step on a sleeping dog’s tail — you might startle the dog. If she barks, that dog startles you right back!</p>
<ul>
<li>But of all startling things that transpired Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club, none was more unexpected than the way Tony Finau rebounded a day after dislocating his left ankle, shooting a four-under 68.</li>
<li>On April 3rd Mr Trump startled aides by calling for troops at the frontier.</li>
<li>A book like this one is particularly valuable in an age when history undergraduates often startle their teachers by their ignorance of basic facts.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/zh/dictionary/english/to-go-to-great-lengths-to-do-something" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>to go to great lengths to do sth</strong></a>(in British): go to a lot of trouble in order to achieve it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latin America shows <strong><font color="red">what is at stake</font></strong>. It has 8% of the world’s people but 38% of its recorded murders (see Briefing). Counting the costs of police, hospitals, victims’ lost incomes and so on, the bill for violent crime comes to 3.5% of GDP. The greater <strong>toll</strong> is human: mothers and fathers burying children, children brought up without a parent and societies deprived of tens of thousands of citizens <strong>in the prime of their lives</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/at%20stake" target="_blank" rel="external">at stake</a>: If something’s at stake, it’s at risk of being lost. </p>
<ul>
<li>The future of our valley and our mountains are at stake.</li>
<li>But there are huge issues at stake over pollution, deportation, health care, offshore drilling, sanctuary cities and much else, and this Administration is huffing and puffing like a tin-horn dictator.</li>
<li>“Our future is at stake with regards to how we see women in our society.”</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/toll" target="_blank" rel="external">toll</a>: A toll is a payment made for something. </p>
<ul>
<li>I bring all this up now because the Seattle mayor just proposed tolling all of downtown as a way to reduce congestion.</li>
<li>Combined with the human toll of the extraction of the energy product, which is immense, this is unconscionable.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/deprived" target="_blank" rel="external">deprived</a>: Being deprived means lacking important things like food and water. </p>
<ul>
<li>“Her office exceeded its lawful authority and retailers were deprived of their due process protections under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,” Mr. Keane said.</li>
<li>She said being sleep deprived is the hardest part of caregiving for her three family members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><font color="red">in the prime of their lives</font></strong>: 在人生的最好时刻，正值盛年</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/prime" target="_blank" rel="external">prime</a>: If something is in its prime, it is at its best. The same goes for a person. If you are young and healthy and in the prime of your life, you are ready to take on the world.<ul>
<li>The son of a golf pro, Mr. Sappenfield, 51 years old, was a prime candidate to purchase a home in one of the many golf-course communities on the outskirts of his native Charlotte, N.C.</li>
<li>Throw in his past two results — second in Tampa, fifth in Orlando, in contention on the back nine on Sunday both times — and he faces expectations like he did in his prime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<font color="red">There is <strong>no excuse for</strong> this suffering. Many of the emerging world’s problems are <strong>intractable</strong>. <strong>Murder is not one of them.</strong></font>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/intractable" target="_blank" rel="external">intractable</a>: Problems are intractable when they can’t be solved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, countless entrepreneurs, companies and governments are looking to use similar databases — often independent of Bitcoin — to solve some of the most intractable issues facing society.</li>
<li>“Though homelessness seems intractable, I believe that it is a solvable issue,” Robbins wrote.</li>
<li>Police perjury is often described as an intractable problem, an unfortunate but unavoidable reality in a criminal justice system that relies to a great degree on the testimony of police officers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dusty death</strong></p>
<p>High murder rates have lots of causes: <strong>fragile government; guns and fighters left over from wars; families broken up and forced into the city by rural violence and poverty; drugs and organised crime that police cannot or will not confront; and large numbers of unemployed young men.</strong></p>
<p><font color="red">The mix of causes in each country is unique but in every case</font> rapid, <strong>chaotic</strong> urbanisation makes the problem worse. Urbanisation itself is welcome, because it boosts incomes and growth. It need not lead to violence—look at India and China, which have relatively low crime rates. But it can <font color="red">feed a <strong>vicious</strong> cycle</font>, as the <strong>proliferation</strong> of murder destroys trust between the police and <strong>the people they are meant to protect</strong>. Residents <strong>keep off</strong> the streets. They no longer support the authorities. <strong>Impunity</strong> grows and the level of violence climbs further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>rapid, <strong>chaotic</strong> urbanisation makes the problem worse.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chaotic" target="_blank" rel="external">chaotic</a>: Something chaotic is really out of control or disorganized.<ul>
<li>Personal freedoms and wealth did increase, but the chaotic nature of the process, compounded by the global financial crisis in 2008, meant that expectations often outpaceffd progress.</li>
<li>Follow his Twitter feed, and you will see a devastating counternarrative to his wife’s determined spin, running reminders of how Donald Trump’s chaotic presidency is veering beyond anything that resembles normal.</li>
<li>To prevent chaotic handouts, they require newcomers to demonstrate proof of need.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But it can feed <strong>a vicious cycle</strong>, <strong>as</strong> the proliferation of murder destroys trust between the police and <strong>the people they are meant to protect</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/vicious" target="_blank" rel="external">vicious</a>: Vicious is an adjective that means intentionally harmful or nasty. If you spread vicious rumors about a person, you’re telling people things that will hurt her feelings or ruin her reputation. Cut it out!<ul>
<li>“Corruption and graft will lead to crises and more coups. It is a familiar and vicious cycle,” Mr. Thitinan said.</li>
<li>She believes the city’s gun problem is rooted in a vicious circle of family members encouraging younger relatives.</li>
<li>Today’s vicious turf wars stem from the nationwide outbreak of armed conflict in 2013, when the predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power and primarily Christian militias known as anti-Balaka fought back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/zh/dictionary/english/vicious-circle" target="_blank" rel="external">vicious circle</a>: A vicious circle is a problem or difficult situation that has the effect of creating new problems which then cause the original problem or situation to occur again.<ul>
<li>The more pesticides are used, the more resistant the insects become so the more pesticides have to be used. It’s a vicious circle. </li>
<li>the vicious circle of poverty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/proliferation" target="_blank" rel="external">proliferation</a>: Proliferation is a rapid multiplication of parts or the increase in the number of something. <ul>
<li>The statistic is one of the few metrics available to track the growth of online church and the proliferation of social media in houses of worship.</li>
<li>While many designers are embracing calm and quiet, others are excited about the proliferation of imaginative, interesting patterns, shapes and textures.</li>
<li>The objective is not to stop the proliferation and use of such weapons, but to use gun violence as an incubator for even more gun ownership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Residents keep off the streets.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/keep%20off" target="_blank" rel="external">keep off</a>: refrain from entering or walking onto （stay clear from; keep away from; keep out of the way of someone or something）<ul>
<li>Whole towns in Siberia were instructed to stay indoors and keep off the streets until the train safely passed.</li>
<li>Havard Lorentzen was the recipient of the gold as the Netherlands was kept off the medal platform for only the second time in that discipline in these Games.</li>
<li>Because it was managed by the Treasury Department and only invested in government securities, the private sector was kept off the playing field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[the streets]: <del>the streets? 流浪者？（不确定）</del></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impunity" target="_blank" rel="external">impunity</a>: （免予受惩罚的）If doing something usually results in punishment, but you do it with impunity, you will not be punished for the deed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hours before the ruling in Mr. da Silva’s case, the four-star general hailed the armed forces’ “repudiation of impunity” and said they were “attentive to their institutional mission.”</li>
<li>Gen. Eduardo Villas Bôas, the chief of the army, raised tensions higher still with his posts on Twitter on Tuesday, declaring that the military “repudiates impunity.”</li>
<li>We all need to reduce our vulnerabilities to Russia’s meddling, and deny impunity to those aiding and abetting those efforts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>That is what faces some of the world’s poor cities. Many already have the <strong>ingredients</strong> of a murder culture. Over the next decades these cities <strong>are set to grow rapidly</strong>. As much as 90% of urban growth will take place in the poor world. By 2030, according to HSBC, a bank, 42 of the 50 most-populous cities will be <strong>in emerging markets</strong>. Dhaka, Karachi and Lagos, each crammed with roughly 25m people, will join the ten largest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ingredient" target="_blank" rel="external">ingredient</a>: An ingredient is one part of a mixture. For example, if you’re making chocolate chip cookies, flour is just one ingredient you’ll need.</p>
<ul>
<li>That is because many generic drugs that contain Chinese ingredients are manufactured in countries like India, meaning they would not be subject to the tariffs.</li>
<li>But it is missing other ingredients for a successful vote, such as an electoral law, political freedoms and security.</li>
<li>An important ingredient, say the books, is a wood fire, around which one is supposed to sit, sipping something warming.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/zh/dictionary/english/emerging-market" target="_blank" rel="external">emerging market</a>: a financial or consumer market in a newly developing country or former communist country</p>
<p><a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/达卡" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Dhaka</strong></a>: 孟加拉国首都达卡；<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/卡拉奇" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Karachi</strong></a>: 巴基斯坦卡拉奇；<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/拉哥斯" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Lagos</strong></a>: 尼日利亚拉各斯</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cram" target="_blank" rel="external">cram</a>: To cram is to crowd or stuff people or things into a limited amount of space. You might be tempted to cram your mouth full of your mom’s chocolate chip cookies, especially if they just came out of the oven and are still warm and gooey.</p>
<ul>
<li>Early in the Serbian segment, workers crammed into an elevator descend into the depths of the mine; the shot mirrors a famous sequence in Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.”</li>
<li>Attendees donated $50 to the campaign, Ms. Gillies said, estimating that about 70 people crammed into her home as her children passed around carrots and pita chips.</li>
<li>This will be a shorter summer window, crammed largely into the post‑World Cup period, which will bring its own complications to be confronted at present without a technical director.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="red">To understand where this can lead, consider</font> Latin America, where seven countries account for a quarter of the world’s murders. Killings often started rising in its cities because of drugs and gangs. Since Latin America urbanised a generation before other developing countries, it has had time to find out <strong>which policies help stop the killing—and which fuel it</strong>.</p>
<p>El Salvador, though off the main drug-trafficking corridor, has struggled to establish peace since the end of civil war in 1992. A weak state failed to <strong>cater for</strong> hundreds of thousands of new city dwellers, <strong>driven into slums</strong> by fighting in the hills. The police were unable to cope with violent new residents who arrived in the slums: street gangs like MS-13 and Barrio 18. In 2015 El Salvador became the world’s <strong>most deadly country</strong> bar Syria. The police still do not know who is killing whom or why. Ninety-five percent of murders go unsolved.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are reasons to think that France is not the country of 23 years ago. For a start, Mr Macron was elected <strong>on</strong> a promise to liberalise the economy and harmonise France’s <strong>myriad</strong> pension regimes so that the same rules apply to all. In contrast, after Mr Chirac came in vowing to heal the “social fracture”, his hard line was seen as a broken promise. In 1995 public opinion backed the grévistes, and support grew even <strong>as the strikes dragged on</strong>. Today commuter lines are creaking, and more of the French accept the need for change. <strong>At the age of 50, most French people have many years of <em>toil</em> ahead of them.

<blockquote>
<p>ON JANUARY 11th 2017 no one was murdered in El Salvador—a fact that was reported as far away as New Zealand, Thailand and Russia. At the time, the Central American country had the highest murder rate in the world: 81 per 100,000, more than ten times the global average (see chart 1). On most days more than a dozen Salvadoreans lost their lives to gang warfare, police shootings and domestic disputes.

And the crime is becoming ever more common.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Latin America is also the most urbanised part of the developing world, and that is not a coincidence. Its urban population grew <strong>in the second half of the 20th century</strong> much faster than those of other regions. By 2000 over three-quarters of the population lived in towns and cities—roughly twice the proportion in Asia and Africa. That move from the countryside concentrated risk factors for lethal violence—inequality, unemployed young men, dislocated families, poor government services, easily available firearms—<strong>even as it also brought together the factors needed for economic growth</strong>. <strong>As other developing economies catch up with Latin America’s level of urbanisation, understanding the process’s links to criminality, and which forms of policing best sever them, is of international concern.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this regard</strong>, <strong>it is worth noting that</strong> the region’s countries <strong>vary a lot</strong>. Some countries in the south of the region have urbanised as fast as those in its north, but murder rates in the south <strong>remain comparable to that of the United States</strong>. The drug trade in the northern part of the region <strong>undoubtedly makes a big difference</strong>. And some countries where murder rose have since seen it decline.</p>
<p>If lessons from those countries that have turned the tide were promulgated a lot of good could be done. The Small Arms Survey, a research group, <strong>has three scenarios for</strong> the world up to 2030: one in which murder trends continue; one in which the trends seen in the countries that are doing best with murder in their region are exported to their neighbours; and one in which trends start to match those in some of the worst-performing countries. <strong>The difference between the best case and the worst adds up to 2.6m lives.</strong></p>

<p>Latin America’s crisis has been mounting at a time when, in the developed world, murder has been becoming rarer. As Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, shows in “Uneasy Peace”, a recent book, the causes of the “great crime decline” America has seen since 1990 are <strong>complex and controversial</strong>: mass incarceration almost certainly reduced violence, though <strong>its impact diminished as</strong> a greater share of the population got locked up, <strong>leaving broken families on the outside</strong>.</p>

<p>Other factors mattered more in other countries. But most of the rich world saw a new stress on the use of data, especially geospatial data, in policing and crime-prevention efforts. That definitely played a role. Some approaches built on knowing precisely what was happening where to whom and why were criticised in terms of both cost efficiency and social justice: “Broken windows” policies stamped down on petty crimes it might have been safe to neglect; “stop-and-frisk” disproportionately targeted young men of colour. But there is now little doubt that, overall, data-driven approaches helped bring down crime rates. And when they succeeded they fostered a new confidence in the police, which encouraged community-driven efforts to reduce crime and co-operate with the authorities, all of which further reduced violence. As Adam Gopnik noted in a review of Mr Sharkey’s book for the New Yorker, <strong>a virtuous circle started to roll.</strong></p>
<p>The Latin American trajectory has been the reverse of the rich world’s: the time of greatest concern in the United States was the time of greatest optimism in the south. In the late 1980s and the 1990s the civil wars and military dictatorships that characterised the 1970s and 1980s were <strong>giving way to</strong> democracies. Tens of millions—some displaced from their farms by guerrilla warfare—flocked to the cities, a willing workforce for the rapid industrialisation that governments hoped to bring about by opening their doors to global trade.</p>

<p>The causes of the bloodshed varied. Extortion gangs were responsible for a lot in some parts of Central America, drug-trafficking in others (though Costa Rica and Panama, both on the drug route, are relatively peaceful). Institutional weaknesses were widespread. Police and prosecutors in the region were badly trained, underpaid and often corrupt. In some places only one in 20 reports of murder led to a conviction. A penchant for ineffective but brutal government crackdowns often made things worse; grossly overpopulated prisons became crime factories rather than rehabilitation centres. To different degrees in different places, these factors all contributed to a vicious circle, rather than a virtuous one: the worse things got, the less effective efforts to stem the tide became.</p>

<p>But one factor seemed to be constant; where murder was high it was also heavily concentrated. According to Robert Muggah of the Igarapé Institute, a Brazil-based think-tank, approximately 80% of homicides in large and medium-sized Latin American cities occur on just 2% of the streets. Identifying those hotspots is crucial. Randomised-controlled trials of homicide-reduction programmes in cities like New York and Los Angeles have shown that policies which use reliable data to give priority to high-risk places, people and behaviour <strong>have the best shot at success</strong>.</p>
<p>In most of Latin America those data are lacking. Many homicide reports say only whether the crime was a knifing or a shooting; locations may just be the name of a town. In a report the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) published in 2012, Lawrence Sherman, a criminologist, concluded that this chronic lack of data “is not an obstacle to solving an important problem. It is the most important problem.”</p>
<p><strong>Truths, not truces</strong></p>
<p>Take El Salvador. In 1996 José Miguel Cruz, a political scientist, gathered data for the IDB’s first regional homicide report there: mayors sent him slips of paper with scrawled tallies marking murders. Today police, prosecutors and coroners meet monthly in San Salvador, the capital, to sort out national totals. But little attempt has been made to understand them, and they are not well used. “Plan Safe El Salvador”, launched in 2015 with support from various international organisations, called for resources to be funnelled to the 50 municipalities which statistics showed to be at highest risk. But because the “municipality prioritisation index” used total crime numbers, rather than rates per person, the plan’s targets for prevention projects were mostly just the biggest towns and cities.</p>

<p>El Salvador’s police claim to collect data good enough to make crime maps that delineate gang territories, but say they cannot release them because doing so could “compromise intelligence operations” and stigmatise residents of violent neighbourhoods.

</blockquote>
<p>[delineate]</p>
<p>[stigmatise]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the homicide report Mr Cruz worked on. He says that shortly before it was published El Salvador’s president begged the IDB to suppress his country’s figures, worried that they would hurt the economy. But the real toll on GDP comes not from reports on violence, but from violence itself. Latin American governments spend an average of 5% of their budgets on internal security—twice as much as developed countries. A recent IDB study estimates the direct costs of violent crime in the region—measured by such things as spending on police, hospitals, insurance and private security, and the lost wages of prisoners—at $236bn a year, calculated on a purchasing-power basis. At $300 per person, that is much higher than in developed countries. In El Salvador the cost of murder works out at 1% of GDP a year. Countries fear that opening data up to independent analysis will reveal the costly ineffectiveness of their policies. But until data analysis improves, their policies will continue to be ineffective, and often erratic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[erratic]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That has certainly been the case in El Salvador. In 2004 President Francisco Flores put soldiers on the streets and threw thousands of gang members into prison to <strong>clamp down</strong> on crime. Murders went up. In March 2012 the government of Mauricio Funes brokered a truce between El Salvador’s three main gangs, giving imprisoned leaders luxuries like flat-screen televisions and fried chicken if they would tell their subordinates to stop killing each other. Murders halved almost overnight, and some criminologists applauded, seeing the policy as a step towards “focused deterrence”—a combination of incentives and threats that is deemed to have worked well in Los Angeles, among other places.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[clamp down]</p>
<p>[deterrence]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Others were wary, with reason. The truce soon began to unravel, and the gangs began to <strong>see violence as a bargaining tool</strong>. In early 2015 President Salvador Sánchez-Cerén sent the army back on to the streets and returned gang leaders to top-security prisons. Murders rocketed to 104 per 100,000 people. The number dropped back by 40% over the next two years, something the government put down to “extraordinary measures” in the prisons; for two years tens of thousands of gang members have seen no relatives, no doctors and no daylight. At the same time the number of members of the public shot by police has gone up 15-fold, sparking an international outcry. “The treatment that the state provides shouldn’t be as bad as the sickness itself,” says the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Agnes Callamard. And for the past six months the murder rate has been on the rise again.</p>

<p>Some Salvadoreans worry their country is heading the way of Venezuela, which stopped releasing murder statistics altogether in 2005. Luisa Ortega Díaz, then Venezuela’s attorney-general, started releasing some numbers again after attending a regional conference on homicide data in 2015; last year she was sacked and subsequently fled the country. According to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, which uses press reports, victimisation surveys and leaks from sympathetic government officials to track murders, Venezuela now has the world’s highest homicide rate.</p>
<p><strong>Colombian data exchange</strong></p>
<p>A generation ago that baleful title belonged to its neighbour, Colombia, where the drugs trade and peasants driven into slums by the civil war came together to dreadful effect. In 1994 the murder rate in Cali was 124 per 100,000 people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[baleful]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rodrigo Guerrero, the city’s mayor and a surgeon by training, launched a plan inspired by the epidemiological approach some North American cities were taking at the time. He set up “violence observatories” where police, public-health officials, academics and concerned citizens could study crime data. This revealed that most of the city’s murders took place in drunken brawls, not in conflict between gangs, and that they were late at night a day or so after payday. Restricting alcohol sales and gun permits helped cut the homicide rate by 35% in a matter of months.</p>
<p>Long-term results were mixed—some crime was probably displaced rather than prevented, and subsequent mayors discontinued the bans—but Mr Guerrero’s data-driven approach to violence spread. In Bogotá, the capital, <strong>data-based policing became the norm</strong>.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that the only way for developing countries to curb high homicide rates on a permanent basis is systemic reform. But data-driven policing can <strong>buy the time</strong>—and create the conditions of trust—needed for such reforms to take place, and can work to <strong>boost the gains from all sorts of other approaches</strong>. In Medellín, where gains against crime have been even more marked than in Cali, targeted action against the local drug cartel and guerrillas first made things safer, and improvements in infrastructure, including cable cars, helped integrate the slums into the city; but data-driven methods learned from Cali also played a role.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2017 Colombia announced a murder rate of 24 per 100,000 people, its lowest in 42 years. That is still high, though, and there are more problems to come. The demobilisation of the FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) after decades of guerrilla war has created local power vacuums that could be filled by organised crime, especially if the government does not create opportunities for ex-combatants, coca farmers and young people. “Colombia is not approaching heaven,” says María Victoria Llorente of the Ideas for Peace Foundation. <strong>“We’re barely leaving hell, and if we aren’t careful, we’ll stay in limbo.”</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A recent proliferation of violence observatories in Latin America—many modelled after Mr Guerrero’s Cali flagship—suggests that governments are realising the need for an evidence-based approach to security policy. But even now only two-thirds of the 60-odd observatories track when and where murders take place, and just half try to determine motives, according to the IDB. In 2016 Ignacio Cano, a Brazilian criminologist, looked at 93 homicide-reduction programmes in the region, including controls on alcohol in Brazil, an advertising campaign exhorting Venezuelans to “value life”, private investigators paid to help public prosecutors in Honduras, a $400m justice reform in Mexico and mediation with criminals in Jamaica and El Salvador. Some coincided with impressive drops in murder rates—but only 16% actually tried to evaluate their impact.</p>

<p>[mediation]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An international campaign called “Instinct for Life” has laid out six principles for reducing murders in Latin America by 50% over the next decade. It stresses both prevention and intervention—and in both cases it sees data as central, whether as a way of revealing what needs to be done or recording the extent to which an intervention has or has not worked. Even without state-of-the-art technology, the campaign says, police could make much better use of the information they already collect.</p>
<p>The rest of the world should <strong>take note</strong>. Murder already outpaces war as a cause of death. And the world is continuing to urbanise. India and China have accommodated huge increases in urban population while keeping violent crime levels relatively low, in part thanks to economic growth. But other countries exhibit many of the risk factors seen in Latin America a generation ago: widespread displacement as a result of conflict, millions of leftover guns, a demographic bulge, little by way of safety nets and corrupt, ineffective police forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The sooner cities and countries build good data analysis into their approach to curbing crime, the fewer of Latin America’s problems they will recapitulate. And they will also spare themselves false hope. A few weeks after that day in El Salvador in January 2017, the police concluded that a body found in a shallow grave had, in fact, been dumped there on January 11th. The murder-free day has yet to dawn.</p>

<p>At the same time, the sex industry is adjusting to cater to young Japanese who are also less interested in carnal pleasures. Once it was common for young men to lose their virginity to prostitutes in Yoshiwara, something known as fudeoroshi, meaning writing with a new brush. Now virgins often remain so indefinitely. A recent survey found that 42% of unmarried men and 44% of unmarried women had never had sex by the age of 35 (over 50% of Japanese men and over 60% of Japanese women are married by the time they are 30-34). Many young people see sex as mendokusai, or tiresome, says Mr Yamada. Services for the young are often about “doing it by themselves—quasi-sex”, Mr Matsushima says. Services that make masturbation more enjoyable are booming, such as websites that offer chats with naked girls or video parlours where men can watch adult DVDs in a private booth.</p>
<p>Some see all this as a sign of the decreasing confidence of Japanese men. Local media talk of “herbivores” who are fearful of independent women. Maid cafés, where women in frilly aprons blow on customers’ food before spooning it into their mouths, are packed with men (and tourists). In soineya stores, or cuddle cafés, clients pay to lie next to a girl. If they pay extra they get a pat or the woman stares directly into their eyes. Sociologists reckon the lack of confidence may also account for another trend in the sex industry: the fetishism of young girls. Some businesses, for example, give men the chance to walk or lie with someone dressed as a schoolgirl, which is legal as long as the sex workers involved are not actually of school age.</p>

Yet the decline in the conventional sex industry does not mean a decline in the overall business of adult entertainment. A study by Yano Research Institute found that sex-related facilities and services grew by 2.1% in 2014, and sales in sex shops by just under 1%, despite Japan’s ageing and shrinking population. Pornhub, the world’s largest porn site, says Japan is its fourth-largest source of traffic.</p>

The route between Beijing and Danjiangkou, which lies on a tributary of the Yangzi, opened in 2014. An eastern route opened in 2013 using the ancient Grand Canal between Hangzhou and the capital. (Jaw-dropping hydrological achievements are a feature of Chinese history.)

<p>The project was controversial from the start. In a rare example of public criticism, China’s vice-minister for housing, Qiu Baoxing, called it difficult to sustain and unnecessary if China would only stop wasting water. Ma Jun, China’s foremost environmentalist, warned that it would increase pollution (which was already bad) and claimed the mere expectation of the project was causing northern cities to use water recklessly. They were depleting local supplies, he thought, because they knew the inundation from the south would one day rescue them.</p>

<p>Officials dismiss such worrywarts. The first years of operation, they claim, show the project to be <strong>an unqualified success</strong>. More than 50m people, according to the water ministry, have been supplied by the system. The water table under Beijing had been subsiding at an alarming rate of between one and three metres a year because of pumping from wells. This has slowed. The project has revived severely eroded ecosystems nearby, such as Lake Juyanhai in Inner Mongolia, which had dried up in 1992. It also promises to boost GDP by 0.1-0.3 percentage points, since economic activities once constrained by water shortages are now able to run normally. But this is hard to measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[subside]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A triumph, then? Hardly. In reality, the project has not solved water shortages in Beijing. Nor has it dealt with the country’s real problems. It has also added difficulties of its own. <strong>At best, it buys a little time in which to get water policies right.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[triumph]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The capital uses about 3.6bn cubic metres of water a year. The city has 2.1bn in local reservoirs and rivers, and the diversion scheme provides 1.1bn. So the project does not cover the current shortfall, which is made up by underground water. As the capital’s population and economy grow, its water consumption could rise to more than 4bn cubic metres a year by 2020. If that happens, and <strong>assuming the scheme runs as advertised</strong>, it would <strong>plug only two-thirds of the gap</strong>. In north China as a whole, water demand is forecast by the government to reach 200bn cubic metres by 2050. The two parts of the water project built so far would cover just one-eighth of that. In short, the project would not solve north China’s water shortages even if it were working as planned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[plug]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it is not. Officially, 9.5bn cubic metres of water a year are supposed to be flowing through the middle route. But officials at the headwaters in Danjiangkou say that less than half of the planned extraction was taken out of the reservoir in 2017. This is partly because the price of reservoir water is high and therefore demand has been lower than expected. But it is also because the reservoir is relatively small: its capacity is 29bn cubic metres. Taking a third of that away each year, engineers worry, would stir up huge quantities of silt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[stir up]</p>
<p>[silt]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The capital still gets almost all the water it was promised. But the provinces surrounding it get barely a third. When the project was designed, officials were at pains to argue that all north China would benefit. In practice, the project has been largely a water-delivery system for the capital. Since Beijing is one of the wealthiest parts of China and the area around the reservoir is relatively backward, the project <strong>takes from the poor and gives to the rich</strong>.</p>
<p>Given that the project is operating at less than its capacity, it might be supposed that it would be causing less damage. Not so. More than 380,000 people had to be moved to make way for the rising waters. Because planners worried about pollution, they closed many of the industries lining canals and reservoirs. These included the mainstays of Danjiangkou’s economy: fish farming and turmeric processing. The result has been high resettlement costs and a <strong>reduced tax base</strong>.</p>

Those rehoused, Mr Zhao thinks, end up with a new house, no savings, no job and 600 yuan a year of income support—not nearly enough to live on.</p>
<p>Downstream from Danjiangkou, pollution has proved intractable. <strong>By diverting water from the Yangzi, the project has made the river more sluggish. It has become less able to wash away contaminants and unable to sustain wetlands, which act as sponges and reduce flooding.</strong> To compensate for water taken from their rivers, local governments are also building dams wherever they can to divert it back again. Shaanxi province, for example, is damming the Han river to transfer water to its depleted river Wei.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[intractable]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worst of all, the project diverts not only water but money and attention from China’s real water problem: waste and pollution. In 2017 water in nearly one-tenth of samples taken from the Yellow river was deemed unfit even for farming. The land ministry says that half the groundwater in the north China plain is too dirty for factories. In Europe 80% of water in industrial processes is recycled. In China the share is half that. In 2015 a study in Nature magazine by Jon Barnett of the University of Melbourne found that China did not need the project. It could be self sufficient, he argued, if it saved water and cut pollution.</p>
<p>To give credit where it is due, the government has started to increase water prices to discourage waste. The project is playing a role. At the end of 2017 a new tariff system went into effect in nine of the 11 water-stressed provinces. Water from the diversion project is pricier than that from local sources, which in theory should mean it will encourage conservation. The trouble is that basic tariffs are still too low. The higher cost of diverted water is borne not by consumers but local governments (such as Beijing’s). So the project has no direct effect on usage. On top of that, urban water infrastructure has long been neglected. Sewers back up, pipes leak. Instead of trying to fix them and rein in demand, China is focusing on boosting supplies.</p>

Its new overlords should heed the advice of Mr Zhang, the project’s first director. “The solution to China’s water-supply problem is conservation,” he said in 2013. “Using water diversion to sustain economic development is a dead end.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DIVERTING water from the south of China to the north is not <strong>the country’s only crazily ambitious drought-alleviation scheme</strong>. The government is also thinking about setting up what would be the world’s largest cloud-seeding operation in Tibet.</p>
<p>China already uses the technique more than most. Now, says the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, a state-owned defence company has built 500 burners on Himalayan ridges in the path of the monsoon. They are testing a system that involves lofting particles of silver iodide from the machines into the atmosphere. When the water-laden air of the monsoon hits the particles, ice crystals are supposed to form and later fall as rain or snow. The hope is to build tens of thousands of these burners and increase rainfall by up to 10bn cubic metres a year in an area the size of Iran that feeds the Yangzi and Yellow rivers as well as others upon which China’s neighbours depend.</p>

<p>But the largest study of iodine cloud-seeding so far, the Wyoming Weather Modification Pilot Programme, found in 2016 that, although the technique can increase precipitation if wind and other conditions are just right, it cannot do so reliably over a long period or on a large scale. Changing the weather in the fragile environment of Tibet could also <strong>be fraught with unintended consequences</strong>.

In addition to the $2bn or so of capital that may be required to expand production of the Model 3, Tesla has some $1.2bn in convertible debt maturing by early next year. On March 27th Moody’s, a credit-rating agency, downgraded Tesla’s debt, cautioning that the firm “will likely need to raise additional capital during the second half of 2019”.

<p>A clearer signal of Alibaba’s ambitions as a provider of services to other outlets came on April 2nd, when it bought the shares it did not already own in Ele.me, valuing the food-delivery platform at $9.5bn. These services span online tools for inventory management to marketing and smartphone payments. They also include labour. Ele.me’s network lets thousands of small restaurants <strong>ferry</strong> dishes to the doors of some of China’s 700m smartphone users. Through the acquisition Jack Ma, Alibaba’s founder, added 3m delivery people to the 2m of Cainiao, boosting the group’s “last-mile” delivery capabilities.</p>
<p>The Ele.me acquisition is a direct challenge to Tencent, a gaming-and-social-media giant owned by Pony Ma (no relation to Alibaba’s founder), which has a large stake in a rival delivery service run by Meituan-Dianping. It is just <strong>the latest offline battlefront</strong> between the two online giants. Since late 2016, each has spent about $10bn to acquire stakes in big traditional retailers. Last year Alibaba bought a large stake in Sun Art, China’s biggest private supermarket operator. In December Tencent responded with a stake in Yonghui Superstores, China’s second-largest, and is considering another in the Chinese operations of Carrefour, a French hypermarket.

<blockquote>
<p>ANYONE who doubts the ambitions of China’s airlines need only look over the plans for Daxing International Airport, which will serve Beijing after it opens in late 2019. It will be the world’s biggest airport by far, with eight runways and room for 100m passengers a year. The new facilities are needed to serve a fast-growing appetite for air travel. The three Chinese carriers that will dominate the passenger traffic passing through Daxing’s cavernous halls are all in rapid ascent. And that has rivals everywhere complaining about the sorts of subsidies that have fuelled airlines since the dawn of commercial aviation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[cavernous]</p>
<p>[ascent]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>China’s airlines are adding passengers at a rate not seen since Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways started to attract customers to their Gulf hubs, handily placed between Europe and Asia, with a winning combination of cheap fares and superior service. Between 2010 and 2017 passenger numbers on China’s three biggest carriers grew by 70%, to 339m (see chart). That growth has translated into some financial high-flying. At the end of March China Southern, Asia’s biggest airline, and China Eastern both reported record annual profits. Air China’s share price fell after it announced that it had only made its best profits since 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[handily]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As China’s carriers expand, their Gulf rivals, which for a decade have seen passenger growth of over 10% a year, are languishing. Slower expansion—or in Qatar’s case, shrinkage—has hit profits hard. It is natural to expect China’s carriers to eclipse those from the Gulf, says Will Horton of CAPA, a consultancy. Those Gulf airlines rely on long-haul passengers connecting in their hubs. China’s carriers are built on more solid foundations of fast-growing local demand. A total of 549m passengers took to the air last year, compared with 184m in 2007. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade group, predicts that China will overtake America as the world’s biggest aviation market by 2022, and will go on to <strong>hit</strong> a total of 1.5bn passengers by 2036.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[eclipse]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of that growth is on international routes. Over the past decade airlines in mainland China have opened over 100 new long-haul routes. These flights mainly serve an increasing urge among Chinese for foreign travel. The number of tourists going abroad, mostly by plane, has <strong>rocketed</strong> in the past decade, from 41m a year to over 130m. As a result, Chinese airlines are gobbling market share, says Dave Emerson of Bain &amp; Company, a consultancy. Between 2011 and 2017 the capacity on Chinese planes flying between China and America rose from 37% to 61%, reckons OAG, a flight-data firm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[gobble]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The battle to fly the Chinese around the globe is not the front that most concerns the world’s other big international airlines, however. The Gulf carriers took business from American and European airlines by getting the world to fly through their hubs. Chinese airlines are also now making the most of their location, and the largesse of the state, to offer connections to destinations beyond their home market.</p>
<p>Chinese regulators limit competition on domestic routes, allowing airlines to make healthy profits to cross-subsidise loss-making international routes chosen to reward allies such as Cuba. China’s smaller cities also give handouts to airlines (around $1.3bn in 2016) to launch new long-haul routes from their airports. All this has created more seats than locals can fill. So the carriers are selling them cheap to foreign travellers looking for a long-haul bargain, explains Mr Horton. The Chinese authorities encourage the practice. They are, for example, loosening immigration checks on connecting travellers and giving some visa-free access to China for six days.</p>
<p><strong>This is hitting regional rivals hardest.</strong> Many Asian carriers were struggling long before the threat from Chinese airlines arose. Carriers such as Malaysia Airlines had allowed costs to run out of control, thanks to poor management and political meddling. But since the visa rules changed, even comparatively well-run airlines, such as Cathay Pacific, have had to <strong>contend with a sea of red ink</strong>. Airlines globally may be enjoying <strong>an era of</strong> record profitability but earnings per passenger for those in Asia have slumped by a sixth since 2015, according to IATA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[meddle]</p>
<p>[slump]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Airlines in America and Europe have less at stake, even if many are already nursing losses on their Chinese operations. But coming on top of competition from low-cost rivals and the Gulf carriers, the arrival of the Chinese acts as another spur to calls for protectionism. America’s three biggest carriers want the “open-skies” agreements that enable the Gulf carriers to fly to America revoked. In Europe, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have been lobbying for a proposed reform of Regulation 868, which would allow the EU to impose sanctions on foreign airlines that get state subsidies.</p>
<p>These tactics will not work on China, warns Andrew Charlton of Aviation Advocacy, a consultancy. Unlike the Gulf states, China is an emerging superpower. It has the power to hit competitors where it hurts. Last June it fined Emirates 29,000 yuan ($4,270) and banned it from expanding in China for six months on trumped-up charges over safety lapses. A trade war over flying rights will hit the West harder than China, which is fast becoming a sizeable exporter of tourists.</p>
<p>Foreign airlines may yet get some respite. The growth in international passengers on Chinese carriers is already slowing, from a breakneck pace of 33% in 2015 to a merely rapid 12% forecast for this year. Many politicians are starting to ask whether some of the subsidies are value for money. And Chinese regulators are belatedly liberalising the domestic market by giving up their control of fares, potentially leaving carriers with less spare cash to subsidise foreign operations. Some smaller airlines are already hitting financial trouble. Hainan Airlines, the country’s fourth-largest carrier, looks wobbly and its owner, HNA Group, is struggling to pay creditors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[breakneck]</p>

<p>And foreigners have ways to fight back. Qantas and Singapore Airlines, for example, are keen to use ultra-haul-long direct flights to attract business travellers keen not to have a layover. The take-off of Chinese airlines looks unstoppable. That does not make them invincible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TALK of tariffs is in danger of developing into cries of trade war. On April 3rd America published a list of some 1,300 Chinese products it proposes to hit with tariffs of 25%. Just a day later China produced its own list, covering 106 categories. “As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate,” said the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[reciprocate]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank, America’s list covers Chinese products worth $46bn in 2017 (9% of that year’s total goods exports to America; see graphic). China’s covers American goods worth around $50bn in 2017 (38% of exports). The sums were enough to move markets on April 4th, though the S&P; 500 index soon made up lost ground.</p>
<p>Both countries’ lists are, for now, no more than threats. Over the next two months America’s list will be open for public consultation (there is no deadline for the tariffs to come into force). China has said that it will wait for America to move. There is still a chance the two sides will choose a deal over a trade war. Although America’s list was drawn up in response to China’s alleged theft of American firms’ intellectual property, Mr Trump regards the trade deficit with China as a separate affront. Tariffs might yet be avoided by China agreeing to buy more American stuff.</p>
<p>But this skirmish follows others. On March 23rd America imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from some countries, including China. That prompted tariffs covering around $3bn of American exports to China. More retaliation is expected, as the Chinese react to separate American tariffs on solar panels and washing machines.</p>
<p>Historians of trade have an advantage over those who study wars of the military kind. Each side in a trade dispute lays out in detail the products to be affected. That makes it easier to analyse their strategies.</p>
<p>Mr Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium turn out to be rather crude. They are an attempt to protect a single industry by blocking foreign competition, guided by a mistaken belief that this will make it stronger. By contrast, China’s retaliation, and the latest American threats over intellectual property, are more sophisticated. Rather than coddling one industry, they are meant to prod a trading partner into changing its behaviour. They are means, not ends.</p>

<p>This week’s American list is designed to hit products benefiting from China’s industrial policy, including its “Made in China 2025” plan to dominate certain strategic sectors. Industrial robots, motors for electric vehicles and semiconductors are all in its sights. (At least 90 products, including aircraft parts and cars, recorded no Chinese exports to America in 2017 and may be intended as a pre-emptive strike.)</p>
<p>That might seem fair in Mr Trump’s eyes. But bureaucrats crafting trade-protection policy face a trade-off between punching the other country and protecting their own consumers. Even before the latest announcement, some offending products had been dropped from America’s list after government analysts identified them as “likely to cause disruptions to the US economy”, or “subject to legal or administrative constraints”. The final choice took account of the availability of substitutes from elsewhere. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimate that of the products proposed for tariffs, only around 20% of America’s imports in 2017 came from China (the share is higher for LEDs, televisions, and printers and copiers).</p>
<p><strong>The element of surprise</strong></p>
<p>Some parts of America’s strategy were unexpected. Minimising disruption to businesses would suggest tariffs on finished goods rather than their inputs. Some companies may not realise that their suppliers are buying from China, so higher costs for intermediate goods could travel along supply chains in unpredictable ways. Pricier parts could make American manufacturers less competitive than foreign rivals. However, although the two biggest tariff lines by value on America’s list were colour-screen televisions and passenger vehicles, consumer products accounted for less than 20% of the affected imports.</p>
<p>What of China? In response to America’s tariffs on steel and aluminium, it placed tariffs on $0.2bn-worth of iron and steel tubes, pipes and hollow profiles, and $1.2bn-worth of aluminium waste. This echoed Canada’s response to the American Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, when it raised tariffs on eggs as retaliation for America doing the same. Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College reports that the number of eggs Canada exported to America fell by 40% between 1929 and 1932. But the number going the other way plunged by 99%. Such tit-for-tat retaliation is intended to demonstrate that trade barriers make industries weaker, not stronger.</p>
<p>The list China published on April 4th is even bolder. It makes no effort to comply with World Trade Organisation rules, and aims at pressure points in America’s democracy, including industries with powerful lobbies, such as aircraft and soyabeans, as well as products from politically sensitive states. Wisconsin is home both to Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a sizeable share of America’s cranberry exporters. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, represents Kentucky, home to America’s bourbon exporters. Both products are included in China’s $50bn tariff threat.</p>
<p>Such methods have worked before. In 2003, when the European Union threatened to put tariffs on American products, including oranges, in retaliation for George W. Bush’s tariffs on European steel, Mr Bush yielded. (Florida, a crucial swing state, is home to many orange-growers.) Mr Trump’s pronouncements do not suggest he is ready to sue for peace. Nor does he seem aware of the risks of failure.</p>
