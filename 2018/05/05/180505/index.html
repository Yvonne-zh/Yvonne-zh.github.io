<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/哈米吉多頓" target="_blank" rel="external">armageddon</a> |ˌɑːməˈgedn| 是基督教《圣经》所述世界末日之时善恶对决的最终战场，引申义指大决战</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RARELY do optimism and North Korea <font color="red">belong in the same breath</font>. However, the smiles and pageantry<font color="#808080">(盛典)</font> in April’s encounter between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in, leaders of the two Koreas, <font color="red">hinted</font> at a deal in which the North would abandon nuclear weapons in exchange for a security guarantee from the world, and in particular America. Sadly, much as this newspaper wishes for a nuclear-free North Korea, <font color="red">a lasting deal remains as remote as the summit of Mount Paektu</font>. The Kims are <font color="red">serial cheats</font> and nuclear weapons <font color="red">are central to their grip on power</font> (see Asia section). Moreover, even as optimists focus on Korea, nuclear restraints elsewhere are unravelling.</p>
<p>By May 12th President Donald Trump must decide the fate of the deal <font color="red">struck</font> in 2015 to curb Iran’s nuclear programme. This week Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, gave a presentation that seemed designed to get Mr Trump to pull America out. He may well <font color="red">oblige</font>. Worse, within three years current agreed limits on the nuclear arsenals<font color="#808080">(军工)</font> of Russia and America are set to lapse, leaving them unconstrained for the first time in almost half a century (see Briefing).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>struck<br>  we have struck a satisfactory bargain: agree, agree on, come to an agreement on, settle on, sign, endorse, ratify, sanction; informal clinch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the cold war a generation of statesmen, chastened<font color="#808080">(愧疚)</font> by conflict and the near-catastrophe of the Cuban missile crisis, used arms control to lessen the risk of annihilation. Even then, nuclear war was a constant fear (see Books section). Their successors, <font color="red">susceptible to hubris<font color="#808080">(傲慢自大)</font> and faced with new tensions and new technology</font>, are increasing the chances that nuclear weapons will spread and that someone, somewhere will miscalculate. <font color="red">A complacent world is playing with Armageddon.</font></p>
<p><strong>START worrying</strong></p>
<p>One problem is that the critics of arms control <font color="red"><strong>overstate its aims so as to denigrate</strong><font color="#808080">(贬低)</font> <strong>its accomplishments</strong></font>. Opponents of the Iran deal, such as John Bolton, Mr Trump’s new national security adviser, complain that it has not stopped Iran from working on ballistic missiles or from bullying its neighbours. But that was never the intent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as it is formally known. Instead, for at least ten years, the pact cuts off Iran’s path to a bomb and makes any future attempt more likely to be detected early. Whatever Mr Netanyahu implies, Iran has kept its side of the agreement despite not getting many of the economic benefits it was promised.</p>
<p>Wrecking the Iranian deal has costs. Iran would be freer to ramp up<font color="#808080">(增加生产)</font> uranium enrichment<font color="#808080">(铀浓缩)</font>, putting it once more <font color="red">in sight of a weapon</font>. The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), still the best bulwark<font color="#808080">(保障)</font> against the spread of the bomb, would be undermined: other countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, may well respond by <font color="red">dusting off their plans</font> to become nuclear powers; and America would be <font color="red">abandoning a fix that shores up the NPT</font>. Mr Trump would have to work even harder to convince Mr Kim that he can trust America—especially as Mr Bolton compares North Korea to Libya, whose leader gave up a nuclear programme <font color="red">only to</font> be toppled<font color="#808080">(overthrow, 颠覆)</font> by the West and butchered a few years later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in (or within) sight of: so as to see or be seen from (within reach of; close to attaining)<br>  Eg: I climbed the hill and came in sight of the house.<br>  Eg: He was safe for the moment and in sight of victory.</p>
<p>shore up: transitive verb[shore up something], [shore something up]<br>  (prop up) «person, prop» 支撑‹building, wall, beam›<br>  figurative (support) 支持‹organization, economy, argument›</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second problem is mistrust, heightened since the revival of great-power competition between America and Russia after a post-Soviet lull<font color="#808080">(间歇)</font>. That ought to give arms control new urgency; instead it is eroding it. Take New START, which caps the number of strategic warheads deployed by Russia and America at 1,550 each. It will expire in 2021 unless Vladimir Putin and Mr Trump extend it, which looks unlikely. Instead Mr Trump boasts that America’s nuclear arsenal will return to the “top of the pack”, bigger and more powerful than ever before. That repudiates<font color="#808080">(否认，拒绝履行)</font> the logic of successive strategic-arms-control agreements with Russia since 1972, which have sought to hold back<font color="#808080">(阻止)</font> a nuclear arms race by seeking to define parity.</p>
<p><strong>Fix it, don’t nix it</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>nix: 口语，否决</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or take the insouciance<font color="#808080">(formal, 无忧无虑)</font> with which the likes of Mr Bolton and his Russian counterparts condemn the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Struck in 1987 by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, this deal dismantled 2,700 groundlaunched nuclear missiles with a range of 500-5,500km that put European deterrence on a hair-trigger. Today each side says the other is violating the INF. Mr Bolton et al argue that it is worth keeping only if it includes countries such as China—-which they know will not happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deterrence: the action of discouraging an action or event through instilling doubt or fear of the consequences<br>  Eg: Nuclear missiles remain the main deterrence against possible aggression<br>  Eg: They contend that a death penalty is necessary as a form of deterrence.</p>
<p>hair-trigger: 一触即发的<br>  Eg: a hair trigger temper: 火暴脾气</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last comes the problem of technology. Better missile defence could undermine mutually assured destruction, which creates deterrence by guaranteeing that a first strike triggers a devastating response. Speaking on March 1st, Mr Putin brandished exotic new nuclear weapons he would soon deploy to counter future American missile defences. A new nuclear arms race, with all its destabilising consequences, is thus likely. A cyber-attack to cripple the other side’s nuclear command and control, which could be interpreted as the prelude to a nuclear first strike, is another potential cause of instability in a crisis. Verifying the capabilities of software is even harder than assessing physical entities such as launchers, warheads and missile interceptors. New approaches are urgently needed. None is being contemplated<font color="#808080">(设想)</font>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>contemplate: it’s too awful to contemplate 这事太可怕了，真不敢去想</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extending New START, saving the INF, creating norms for cyber-weapons and enhancing the Iran deal are eminently doable<font color="#808080">(可行的)</font>, but only if there is <font color="red">sufficient will</font>. For that to gel<font color="#808080">(胶状物，<strong>具体化</strong>)</font>, today’s statesmen need to overcome a fundamental misunderstanding. They appear to have forgotten that you negotiate armscontrol agreements with your enemies, not your allies. And that arms control brings not just constraints on weapons of unimaginable destructive force, but also verification that provides knowledge of capabilities and intentions. In a crisis, that can reduce the risk of a fatal miscalculation.</p>
<p>Cherish the scintilla<font color="#808080">(一星半点)</font> of hope in North Korea, and remember how arms control needs shoring up. The alternative is a future where countries arm themselves because they cannot be sure their enemies will not get there first; where every action could escalate into nuclear war; where early warnings of a possible attack give commanders minutes to decide whether to fire back. It would be a tragedy for the world if it took an existential scare like the Cuban missile crisis, or worse, to <font color="red">jolt<font color="#808080">(震惊)</font> today’s complacent</font>, reckless leaders back to their senses. </p>
<h3 id="T-Mobile-and-Sprint-Block-the-call"><a href="#T-Mobile-and-Sprint-Block-the-call" class="headerlink" title="T-Mobile and Sprint: Block the call"></a>T-Mobile and Sprint: Block the call</h3><p><strong><font color="#808080">(Regulators should squash plans for a big telecoms merger in America)</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>squash: firmly reject (an idea or suggestion): the proposal was immediately squashed by the Historical Society.<br>  the proposal was immediately squashed: reject, block, cancel, scotch, frustrate, thwart, suppress, put a stop to, nip in the bud, put the lid on; informal put the kibosh on, stymie, scuttle, deep-six.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SO MANY false starts would have soured other romances. Resistance from antitrust authorities halted a union between T-Mobile and Sprint, America’s third and fourth-largest wireless carriers, in 2014. A row over merger terms scuppered<font color="#808080">(使泡汤)</font> talks last year. But the attraction never dimmed.</p>
<p>This week the pair announced an all-stock deal that would create a company with a heft similar to that of AT&amp;T and Verizon. The happy couple promises lower prices for customers, higher profits for shareholders and a sharpening of America’s technological edge (see Business section). Regulators should be sceptical. The tie-up is bad for consumers; and there are better ways to build whizzy<font color="#808080">(technologically innovative or advanced)</font> new networks.</p>
<p>Consumer welfare first. The international evidence suggests that cutting the number of big operators would be bad for customers. Research by British regulators into 25 countries shows that average prices were up to one-fifth lower in markets with four network operators than in those with three. (Ignore the claims of T-Mobile and Sprint that the American market is contested by as many as eight firms: in its latest report on the industry, the Federal Communications Commission found that the four carriers accounted for over 98% of connections.)</p>
<p>T-Mobile itself is testament<font color="#808080">(证明)</font> to the benefits of a more crowded market. Trustbusters<font color="#808080">(反托拉斯法执行人)</font> not only zapped its discussions in 2014 with Sprint but also blocked an earlier attempt by AT&amp;T to buy it in 2011. The firm has thrived on its own. It has added almost 40m customers in the past five years by cutting prices and adding features such as free video-streaming. Subscribers everywhere have felt the benefits. Between 2013 and 2016 overall consumer prices in America rose by 4.5%; prices for wireless telephone services decreased by 8%. Consolidation threatens a different outcome. The combined firm projects relatively slow growth in revenue, a jump in profit margins and rapid deleveraging. That does not sound like the plan for a price war.</p>
<p>If regulators have opposed such tie-ups before, why do TMobile and Sprint expect a different answer this time? One explanation is the risk that Sprint, which is heavily indebted and has been struggling for a while, might go bust if it remains a stand-alone entity. But that ought not to sway the trustbusters. Sprint could shed its debts in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and re-emerge in better shape, or it might get swallowed up by a different firm entirely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>go bust: his haulage business went bust and he owes £120,000: fail, collapse, crash, fold (up), go under, founder, be ruined, cave in; go bankrupt, become insolvent, cease trading, go into receivership, go into liquidation, be liquidated, be wound up, be closed (down), be shut (down); informal go broke, go bump, go to the wall, go belly up, come a cropper, flop, flatline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trumpeterian destruction</strong></p>
<p>The second explanation is that the two firms think that they can win a public-interest argument about technological leadership. The bosses of T-Mobile and Sprint argue that by bringing together their bands of spectrum, they would be able to build America’s first national 5G network. Their merger presentation, featuring slides with headlines such as “US must lead innovation again” and “Global economic leadership is at stake!”, was aimed as much at economic nationalists in the White House as analysts with spreadsheets.</p>
<p>It is true that 5G networks are expensive to build: they require more antennae, base stations and fibre-optic cables than their predecessors. It is also true that 5G’s speed provides a platform upon which all sorts of data-hungry new services, from self-driving cars to industrial robots, can develop. But that does not mean operators have to build their own, separate networks. Mobile providers in South Korea have agreed to share the costs and use of 5G infrastructure. Mexico is building a wholesale mobile network; its capacity can be leased out to different firms. Better this approach than muted competition and price-gouged consumers. The union of T-Mobile and Sprint is one that regulators should not bless. </p>
<h3 id="Britain’s-Windrush-scandal-Identity-crisis"><a href="#Britain’s-Windrush-scandal-Identity-crisis" class="headerlink" title="Britain’s Windrush scandal: Identity crisis"></a>Britain’s Windrush scandal: Identity crisis</h3><p><strong><font color="#808080">(The mistreatment of Caribbean Britons shows the need for a better way of checking identity)</font></strong></p>
<p>THE harassment of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants is a shameful chapter in Britain’s history, and ministers are paying for it. One home secretary resigned on April 29th; her predecessor, Theresa May, now the prime minister, is weakened. It falls to Sajid Javid, who took charge of the Home Office this week, to clear up the mess.</p>
<p>There is little to like about Mrs May’s migration policy. The state-led hounding of thousands of law-abiding British citizens was a side-effect of the “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants that she created as home secretary.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mrs May’s rigid insistence on reducing net inflows to the arbitrary level of 100,000 a year created a hostile environment for all migrants, not just the illegal ones (see Britain section). Landlords, employers and others were given new duties to check people’s migration status. The result has been that those with incomplete paperwork have been denied homes, jobs and public services, and have even been locked up. Mrs May sent mobile billboards bearing the legend “GO HOME OR FACE ARREST” to migrant-heavy districts. She ridiculed “citizens of nowhere” and threatened to make companies publish lists of their foreign workers (before backing down). Cowboyish Home Office officials desperate to reach their targets have used any excuse to notch up ejections. Claiming to crack down on illegal migrants, they even broke the law themselves.</p>
<p>For all its shortcomings, Mrs May’s approach does contain one idea that is worth preserving: enforcement should happen inland, not just at the border. Most of Britain’s half-million or so illegal immigrants did not enter the country illicitly but have overstayed their visas. Furthermore, from the camps of Calais to the Mediterranean sea, there is plenty of evidence that fortifying borders does not stop lots of people continuing to try to cross them. The result is migrants’ suffering, extra cost to taxpayers and a bonanza for people-smugglers.</p>
<p>The Windrush debacle highlighted that Britain has no easy way of carrying out this inland enforcement. The government’s guide for landlords who need to verify tenants’ migration status is 35 pages long. If landlords get it wrong they risk a fine or even imprisonment. Researchers have shown that, unsurprisingly, they tend to err on the side of caution, rejecting those without passports (and especially those who are not white). The result is pressure against all migrants, and also against ethnic minorities, British or otherwise. After Brexit the problem will be worse, as 3m Europeans will be allowed to remain permanently but without passports.</p>
<p>The scandal has rightly provoked calls for an overhaul of migration enforcement. Any rethink must get to the root of the problem. This is not that Britain checks the status of migrants, as any country must if it values the rule of law. The real shortcoming is that Britain, rarely among advanced countries, lacks a simple, non-discriminatory way to check the identity of its population. Under Mr Javid it should get one.</p>
<p>Liberals, including this newspaper, have argued against national identity registers on the basis that they invade privacy and aid oppression by the state. But the balance of this tradeoff has changed. In a globalised world more people spend time travelling, studying or working abroad, and access to labour markets and public services depends on their exact status. Proving identity thus matters more than ever. Countries like Britain that lack an ID register rely on other proofs—bank statements, tax records, phone bills—that are even more intrusive. As for the risk of oppression, the Windrush affair shows that it is not just all-knowing states that have the power to persecute their citizens. It was precisely the opacity of information that the Home Office exploited in order to pursue many thousands of people who had a right to be in Britain.</p>
<p><strong>Papers please</strong></p>
<p>Setting up an identity register would not be cheap or easy. A previous, abortive effort to roll out ID cards a decade ago was priced at about £5bn ($7bn). It would probably have to involve an element of amnesty for those caught up in a Windrushstyle trap of missing paperwork. But Brexit is forcing Britain to think hard about matters of migration and citizenship. Taking back control of who enters the country is one of the biggest prizes advertised by Brexiteers. To do that, Britain must first have a better idea of who is already there. </p>
