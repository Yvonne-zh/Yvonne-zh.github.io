        <h2 id="Leaders"><a href="#Leaders" class="headerlink" title="Leaders"></a>Leaders</h2><h3 id="The-100-billion-bet"><a href="#The-100-billion-bet" class="headerlink" title="The $100 billion bet"></a>The $100 billion bet</h3><p><strong><font color="#808080">Succeed or fail, Masayoshi Son is changing the world of technology investing</font></strong></p>
<p>TWO years ago, if you had asked experts to identify the most influential person in technology, you would have heard some familiar names: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Alibaba’s Jack Ma or Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. Today there is a new contender:<br>Masayoshi Son. The founder of SoftBank, a Japanese telecoms and internet firm, has put together an enormous investment fund that <font color="red">is busy gobbling up<font color="#808080">(大口吞吃)</font> stakes</font> in the world’s most exciting young companies. The Vision Fund is disrupting both the industries in which it invests and other suppliers of capital.</p>
<p>The fund is the result of a peculiar alliance forged in 2016 between Mr Son and Muhammad bin Salman. Saudi Arabia’s thrusting crown prince handed Mr Son $45bn as part of his attempt to diversify the kingdom’s economy. That great dollop of capital attracted more investors—from Abu Dhabi, Apple and others. Add in SoftBank’s own $28bn of equity, and Mr Son has a war chest of $100bn. That far exceeds the $64bn that all venture capital (VC) funds raised globally in 2016; it is four times the size of the biggest private-equity fund ever raised (see Briefing). One VC grandee<font color="#808080">(大人物)</font> calls Vision Fund “the most powerful investor in our world”.</p>
<p><strong>Masastroke…</strong></p>
<p>Power does not necessarily mean success. <font color="red">Sceptics about the Vision Fund have lots of ammunition<font color="#808080">(弹药、证据)</font>.</font> After a long bull market, the valuations of tech firms are stretched. Mr Son personally makes most of the investing decisions. He has <font color="red">notched up<font color="#808080">(获得，赢得)</font> some triumphs</font> in his career, including an early bet on Alibaba. But his dotcom-era investments mean he is also the person to have lost more money than anyone else in history. His pursuit of the “singularity”, the point at which computer intelligence exceeds the human kind, might <font color="red">make him a visionary—or just an eccentric</font>. The money is being shovelled<font color="#808080">(口语push)</font> out almost as fast as it was taken in. The fund has already spent $30bn, nearly as much as the $33bn raised by the entire American VC industry in 2017. And because about half of its capital is in the form of debt, it is under pressure to make interest payments. This combination of gargantuanism, grandiosity and guaranteed payouts may end up in financial disaster. Indeed, the Vision Fund could mark the giddy<font color="#808080">(令人飘飘然的)</font> top of the tech boom.</p>
<p>But even if the fund ends up flopping<font color="#808080">(沉重的落下)</font>, it will have several lasting effects on technology investing. The first is that the deployment of so much cash now will help shape the industries of the future. Mr Son is pumping money into “frontier technologies” from robotics to the internet of things. He already owns stakes in ride-hailing firms such as Uber; in WeWork, a coworking company; and in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce firm that was this week sold to Walmart (see Business section). In five years’ time the fund plans to have invested in 70-100 technology unicorns<font color="#808080">(独角兽)</font>, privately held startups valued at $1bn or more. <font color="red">Its money, often handed to entrepreneurs in multiples of the amounts they initially demand and accompanied by the threat that the cash will go to the competition if they balk<font color="#808080">(畏缩)</font>, gives startups the wherewithal<font color="#808080">(必要的资源)</font> to outgun<font color="#808080">(在火力上压过)</font> worse-funded rivals.</font> Mr Son’s bets do not have to pay off for him to affect the race.</p>
<p>Mr Son’s second impact will be on the venture-capital industry. To compete with the Vision Fund’s pot of moolah<font color="#808080">(金钱)</font>, and with the forays<font color="#808080">(初步尝试)</font> of other unconventional investors, incumbents are having to bulk up. Sequoia Capital,one of Silicon Valley’s most famous names, is raising its biggest-ever fund in response. Mr Son is also bringing capital to places where it is still in fairly short supply—to India, to South-East Asia and to several European countries. When the Vision Fund invested close to $500m in Improbable, a British virtual-reality firm, it broke a funding record, and its €460m ($565m) in Auto1, a German online car dealer, was one of the country’s biggest such investments in several years. Rather than wait for founders to make the trip to California, investors are under greater pressure to seek out entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The Vision Fund’s unprecedented span, across countries and industries, leads to its third impact. Mr Son says he wants to create a “virtual Silicon Valley in SoftBank”, meaning a platform on which unicorns can offer each other contacts and advice, buy goods and services from each other, and even join forces. The concept of portfolio companies collaborating is familiar from private equity, but the fund’s sheer breadth marks it out. Mr Son is, for example, trying to orchestrate<font color="#808080">(精心谋划)</font> his various ride-hailing investments so that they do not burn through so much cash by competing with each other. He encouraged Uber to sell its South-East Asian business to Grab earlier this year and is urging it to make a deal in India with Ola.</p>
<p>The Vision Fund model is disruptive, then. But is it good for innovation and consumers? Mr Son’s project certainly has its attractions. It is shaking up the cosy world of Silicon Valley venture capital. And it may nurture competition against the tech giants. The fund offers founders of startups an alternative to cashing out to the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon; its massive chequebook also gives those entrepreneurs a better shot at competing with the titans. The fund may perform a similar function in China, where nearly half of all unicorns are by now backed by one of the country’s four tech giants, Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent or JD.com.</p>
<p><strong>…or Masachism?</strong></p>
<p>Yet its disadvantages extend beyond the risk of losses. Its sheer size risks raising the cost of running a startup for everyone. Young firms that receive its cash often spend it on sales and marketing, which puts pressure on every other company in the industry to spend as lavishly<font color="#808080">(大量的，奢华的)</font> in order to acquire customers. Companies that receive hundreds of millions of dollars of capital in one go are elevated far above their competitors. That hands a single individual kingmaking powers, while keeping young firms out of the clarifying glare of the public markets for even longer. Attempts to carve up markets among portfolio firms may in time raise a different set of competition concerns.</p>
<p>A proper verdict on the Vision Fund will not be possible for years. But the fate of many startups and the choices consumers enjoy in the future will be guided by the bets Mr Son is making today. Fortune’s biggest wheel is spinning.</p>
<h3 id="The-woes-of-Argentina-Tango-tantrum"><a href="#The-woes-of-Argentina-Tango-tantrum" class="headerlink" title="The woes of Argentina: Tango tantrum"></a>The woes of Argentina: Tango tantrum</h3><p><strong><font color="#808080">(Argentina has much in common with yesterday’s emerging markets, but little in common with today’s)</font></strong></p>
<p>YAWNING deficits, stubborn inflation, a plunging currency, spiking<font color="#808080">(尖锐的)</font> interest rates, dwindling reserves and a humbling turn to the IMF. Argentina seems to be going through a classic emerging-market crisis, culminating in the government’s decision this week to seek a precautionary loan from the fund—an institution that fears Argentina almost as much as Argentina fears it.</p>
<p>The country is not quite repeating its own crisis-ridden history. Argentina today has a reformist government largely intent on doing the right thing, rather than the populist administrations that blighted<font color="#808080">(枯萎，弄坏)</font> its recent past (see Finance section). But its troubles are real. Many wonder if they will spread to other emerging markets. Several economies share one or two of its vulnerabilities. <font color="red">Mercifully</font> few share all of them.</p>
<p>Argentina’s rate of inflation, which exceeds 25%, seems to belong to a lost world. Only in Egypt, Nigeria and Turkey (among notable economies; Venezuela is on a different planet) is inflation even in double digits. It is now comfortably below the government’s target in Brazil, China and Russia (among other places) and uncomfortably below it in Thailand. These countries’ monetary authorities have already won the battle for price stability that Argentina is still waging.</p>
<p>In several emerging economies, including Brazil, Egypt and India, the government finances are, if anything, worse than in Argentina. Brazil’s fiscal deficit is projected to exceed 8% of GDP this year, according to the IMF, compared with an overall deficit of 5.5% for Argentina. But even as these other countries’ governments live far beyond their means, their private sectors are living well within them. For that reason, their large fiscal deficits have not translated into equally large current-account deficits with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And although many emerging markets have heavy debts, they do not share Argentina’s old-fashioned need to borrow in other countries’ currencies. Almost 64% of Argentina’s combined government and corporate debt is denominated<font color="#808080">(结算)</font> in dollars and other foreign monies, according to the Institute of International Finance. Among the big emerging markets, only Turkey compares, with 56%. The equivalent figure for Thailand is 17%, for Brazil only 16%.</p>
<p><strong>Let it go</strong></p>
<p>Low inflation, modest current-account deficits and limited foreign-currency debt thus distinguish many of today’s emerging markets from the peso—and from their own past. These attributes do not render them immune from the global financial forces that have rocked the peso. All emerging economies, even the biggest, must still watch the Federal Reserve, rising American bond yields and the strengthening dollar with trepidation. In many cases their long-term interest rates seem as sensitive to America’s central bank as to their own.</p>
<p>But their new virtues do give emerging economies more room for manoeuvre. They can ease their own interest rates if borrowing costs rise too much. And if capital flees they can allow their currencies to fall without the economy faltering. That is because they need not worry that a one-off rise in import prices will translate into ongoing inflation or that a weaker exchange rate will render dollar debts impossible to service.</p>
<p>The distinctions between Argentina and the broader group of emerging markets have not gone unnoticed. In 2009 the country was even reclassified as a “frontier” market by MSCI, an index provider. But in its struggles with inflation, deficits, dollar debt and depreciation, Argentina’s economy resembles a classic emerging market more faithfully than many economies that still carry the label.</p>
<h3 id="Compensating-blood-donors-Blood-money"><a href="#Compensating-blood-donors-Blood-money" class="headerlink" title="Compensating blood donors: Blood money"></a>Compensating blood donors: Blood money</h3><p><strong><font color="#808080">(Many countries ban payment for blood plasma. This is mistaken)</font></strong></p>
<p>THIS year marks the 200th anniversary of the first successful human-to-human blood transfusion, conducted by James Blundell, an English obstetrician working just across the Thames from The Economist’s offices. Today blood is big business—with global exports worth more, in 2016, than global exports of aeroplanes. But that trade is distorted by the refusal of most governments to allow payment to people who give plasma, blood’s yellowish liquid component.</p>
<p>The blood trade today consists mostly not of blood for transfusion, demand for which is falling as medical techniques improve, but of plasma (see International section). Most of this comes from plasma-collection centres, where it is extracted from whole blood and the platelets and blood-cells are transfused back into the donor. Plasma is used to make drugs such as factor VIII, which helps haemophiliacs’ blood to clot, and vaccines for rabies, tetanus and Rhesus disease. Almost 50m litres of it were used in 2015, enough to fill 20 Olympic swimming pools. America, the OPEC of plasma, produces 15 of those swimming-pool equivalents. Forget steel and cars: plasma makes up 1.6% of America’s total goods exports.</p>
<p>The secret of this success is simple: America lets companies pay people for their plasma. So do the few other countries that are good at collecting the stuff, including Germany and Hungary. Others don’t. Big importers such as Australia, France and Belgium have banned payment. In Canada, where the issue is a live debate, the lone company trying to collect paid plasma has recently been banned in two provinces and risks the same in a third.</p>
<p><strong>Blood and treasure</strong></p>
<p>The aversion to paid plasma rests on three <font color="red">reasonable-sounding but largely groundless propositions</font>. The first is that it is unsafe. Payment might encourage donors to conceal dangerous behaviour—such as intravenous drug use. In the 1980s and 1990s, tainted blood products infected half the world’s haemophiliacs with HIV, along with tens of thousands of plasma donors in China. But modern plasma products do not carry such risks. They are heat-treated and bathed in chemicals to sanitise them (an impossibility for blood for transfusion). Since the adoption of these techniques there has not been a single case of transmission of HIV or hepatitis via plasma products. Doctors agree that plasma products from paid donors are just as safe as those from unpaid ones.</p>
<p>A second argument is that, if people are paid for their plasma, fewer will volunteer to donate whole blood for transfusions. (Paying for whole blood would be unwise, since it cannot be sterilised as plasma can.) But there is no evidence that paying for plasma diminishes the supply of donated blood. That is why, in Canada, more than 30 economists and philosophers wrote an open letter arguing against bans on paid plasma. Americans voluntarily donate as much blood per person as do Canadians.</p>
<p>A third argument is that paying for plasma preys on the poor. It is possible that those selling plasma need the money and therefore might give too often. In America plasma donors can give twice a week; those in Europe can give just once a week. There is no evidence of harm to their health in either case, but more long-term study would be prudent.</p>
<p>Those against allowing payment suggest using voluntary donors instead. Yet every country that does not pay ends up importing plasma. And the fact that America is by far the dominant supplier carries risks of its own. The dependence on a single source leaves the rest of the world vulnerable to an interruption of supply. To protect their people, therefore, other governments need to diversify their supplies of plasma. Paying for it would make a big difference. 7</p>
<h3 id="Iran-and-America-A-new-deal"><a href="#Iran-and-America-A-new-deal" class="headerlink" title="Iran and America: A new deal?"></a>Iran and America: A new deal?</h3><p><strong><font color="#808080">(Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran deal is unlikely to do anyone any good)</font></strong></p>
<p>BY PULLING out of the Iran nuclear deal, President Donald Trump is counting on renegotiation or regime change. He is more likely to end up with war.</p>
<p>On May 8th Mr Trump did not cut America’s ties with the Iran deal so much as take an axe to it. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as it is known, curtails Iran’s nuclear programme for a number of years and permanently subjects it to intrusive inspections, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Mr Trump’s withdrawal from the “decaying and rotten” agreement honoured a campaign promise. However, the president was unexpectedly harsh in vowing to extend sanctions, not just restore them, and to punish any firm doing business with Iran wherever it is based.</p>
<p>Since the UN says that Iran was honouring the agreement, as even its critics allow, Mr Trump has strengthened the arguments of foes that America cannot be trusted and that the global rules it claims to uphold are made to be broken. The question for the other parties to the deal (Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the European Union) is: what next? The question for the world as a whole, especially the Middle East, is: what does this mean for Iran’s ability to get the bomb?</p>
<p>First tragedy, then Farsi</p>
<p>In Tuesday’s announcement Mr Trump offered his own answers. He said that he is “ready, willing and able” to negotiate a new deal that limits Iran’s regional aggression as well as its nuclear weapons, though he offered no plan for bringing that about. He also issued a veiled appeal to the Iranian people, who he said are being held “hostage” by their government, to rise up against their oppressors.</p>
<p>At its heart, Mr Trump’s plan is based on a hunch about sanctions. First it assumes that, with heavier sanctions, Iran’s economy will be less able to finance warfare in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Yet Iran’s belligerenceisnottheoutcomeofa book-keeping exercise. Notwithstanding last year’s street protests, which called for more spending at home, Iran finances troops, militias and terrorists because it craves influence and it perceives threats. Mr Trump set out to intimidate Iran this week: he may have left it more determined.</p>
<p>Second, Mr Trump assumes that economic pain from new sanctions could force Iran to the negotiating table, as it did North Korea. Heavy sanctions can indeed lead regimes to negotiate, as Iran showed in the deal that Mr Trump has now rejected. But Mr Trump displays little sense of how the very leaders he has just welched on can surrender wholesale to his demands and survive.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is the point, and his real bet is that sanctions will bring about economic agonies that topple the regime. The mullahs will not rule Iran for ever. But the Castros in Cuba have withstood sanctions for decades. Iran’s theocrats have proved perfectly willing to keep order by force.</p>
<p>This newspaper would welcome an end to Iranian belligerence and to the regime itself, but a wish based on a hunch is not a policy. Instead, faced with the probable failure of Mr Trump’s scheme, the parties to the deal should strive to keep it alive for as long as they can. One aim is to demonstrate to Mr Trump and his supporters that global rules do matter. The EU should, for instance, continue to meet Iranian officials and protest to the World Trade Organisation about American sanctions on its companies, as it did 20 years ago when America applied secondary sanctions over Cuba. The other aim is to hold  Iran back from restarting its nuclear-weapons programme. Realistically, however, China and Russia may not want to dig Mr Trump out of the hole he has made for himself, and the EU cannot save the deal on its own. The dollar is still dominant (though Mr Trump has surely brought forward the day when China clears global payments in yuan). Companies with a choice between operating in America or Iran will inevitably<br>choose the bigger market.</p>
<p>So the gains from a partial deal will be negligible and Iran may well sooner or later restart its nuclear programme. The Iran deal guarded against that, by providing an early warning and the option to reimpose sanctions. Without it, Iran may seek to return to the old limited inspections regime, to build new centrifuges, to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade and to miniaturise warheads. If the Iranian programme goes underground—literally and figuratively—there may not be enough intelligence to assess the threat. Moreover, with sanctions already ratcheted up high, Mr Trump and his successors will have limited diplomatic scope to get Iran to stop. Instead, they will have to resort to military action.</p>
<p>You do not go to war with Iran lightly—would Mr Trump fight over, say, some extra centrifuges? Iran would be able to creep towards the nuclear threshold. And, unlike the Iraqi and Syrian programmes, which were destroyed in one mission by the Israeli air force, Iran’s know-how and industrial capacity cannot be bombed out of existence. If Iran is determined to get a weapon, America or Israel will have to bomb it every few years. How would they justify that? It is hard to think of any previous American president tossing aside an international agreement for such poor odds and at such a heavy cost. </p>
